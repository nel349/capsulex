# Thread-based Social Feed

## Overview
A Twitter-like or Reddit-like post & reply system created by combining components from `src/components/thread` and `src/state/thread`.

## Key Features

### 📱 Content Types
Users can post various content:
- Text posts
- Images and media
- Interactive polls
- Trade information
- NFT listings (including **Collection Floor** listings)
- **Retweet/Quote Retweet** support

### 🧩 Component Structure
Built from modular components:
- `Thread.tsx` - Container for multiple posts (root-level)
- `ThreadItem.tsx` - Renders a single post with optional replies
- `ThreadComposer.tsx` - For composing new posts or replies
- `ThreadEditModal.tsx` - In-line editing of text-only post sections
- Post sub-components:
  - `PostHeader`
  - `PostBody`
  - `PostFooter`
  - `PostCTA`
- Retweet sub-components:
  - `RetweetModal.tsx` (modal to quote-retweet or retweet a post)
  - `RetweetPreview.tsx` (inline preview of a retweeted post)

### 🔄 State Management
Utilizes Redux for state handling:
- Async thunks for data fetching
- Post creation and reply creation
- Retweet flow (server or local fallback)
- Edit and delete operations
- Reaction additions and local fallback

### 🎨 Customization
- Theme customization via `thread.theme.ts`
- Styling utilities in `thread.styles.ts`
- Type definitions in `thread.types.ts`
- Optional callbacks for advanced usage:
  - `onPressPost`
  - `onPressUser`
  - `ctaButtons`
  - `onRefresh`
  - and more...

### 🆕 Highlights / New Additions
- **Disable Replies**: `disableReplies` prop for `Thread` or `ThreadItem` to hide nested replies.
- **onPressUser**: callback when a user’s avatar or name is tapped.
- **NFT Collection Listing**: Post can represent an entire collection floor buy.
- **TradeModal** `disableTabs` option: lock users into a single tab (e.g. “Swap & Share”).
- **ThreadEditModal**: A straightforward modal that lets owners edit text sections of their post.
