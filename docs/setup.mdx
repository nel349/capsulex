# Setup & Installation

* **Install Xcode from the App Store**
* **Clone the directory**
  ```
  git clone ...
  cd solana-app-kit
  ```
* **Install dependencies**
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
* **Put your .env in both root and server folders (.env.local for client code)**
* **Start Metro**
  ```
  yarn start --clear
  ```
  Or just
  ```
  yarn start
  ```
  Note: `--clear` removes cachesâ€”avoid running it too often to prevent slow builds.

## If You Still Face Issues

* In a normal terminal:
  ```
  sudo gem install cocoapods
  pod --version
  ```
* Then navigate to the ios folder:
  ```
  cd ios
  pod install
  ```
