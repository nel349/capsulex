# CapsuleX Anchor Program - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document provides a complete overview of the CapsuleX Anchor program structure, clarifying exactly where and why SPL tokens are used in your time capsule and gamified guessing game project.

## SPL Token Usage Clarification

### ✅ **WHERE SPL Tokens ARE Used:**
1. **Time Capsule NFTs**: Each capsule is minted as an NFT using `anchor-spl`
2. **Winner Badge NFTs**: Game winners receive NFT badges as rewards
3. **Trophy NFTs**: Achievement-based NFTs for leaderboard milestones

### ❌ **WHERE SPL Tokens are NOT Used:**
1. **Payment Currency**: All fees and rewards use SOL directly
2. **Custom Tokens**: No custom fungible tokens are created
3. **Game Economics**: Pure SOL-based reward system

## Program Architecture

### Core Account Structures
```rust
// Time capsule with NFT mint reference
pub struct Capsule {
    pub creator: Pubkey,
    pub nft_mint: Pubkey,        // SPL Token mint for NFT
    pub content_hash: String,
    pub reveal_date: i64,
    pub is_gamified: bool,
    // ... other fields
}

// Game state with SOL-based fees
pub struct Game {
    pub capsule_id: Pubkey,
    pub guess_fee: u64,          // Fee in lamports (SOL)
    pub total_fees_collected: u64, // SOL collected
    pub winner: Option<Pubkey>,
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Fee Structure (SOL-based)
- **Base Fee**: 0.000005 SOL (5000 lamports)
- **Capsule Creation**: 0.00005 SOL (10x base)
- **Guessing Fee**: 0.00001 SOL (2x base)
- **Premium Features**: 0.000025 SOL (5x base)

### Reward Distribution (SOL-based)
- **50%** to game winner
- **20%** to capsule creator  
- **30%** to app operations

## Key Instructions

### 1. Time Capsule Operations
```rust
// Create capsule with NFT mint
pub fn create_capsule(
    ctx: Context<CreateCapsule>,
    content_hash: String,
    reveal_date: i64,
    is_gamified: bool,
) -> Result<()>

// Mint capsule as NFT (uses anchor-spl)
pub fn mint_capsule_nft(
    ctx: Context<MintCapsuleNft>,
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    uri: String,
) -> Result<()>
```

### 2. Game Operations
```rust
// Initialize game with SOL-based fees
pub fn initialize_game(
    ctx: Context<InitializeGame>,
    capsule_id: Pubkey,
    max_guesses: u32,
    guess_fee: u64,  // SOL amount
) -> Result<()>

// Submit guess with SOL payment
pub fn submit_guess(
    ctx: Context<SubmitGuess>,
    guess_content: String,
    is_paid: bool,
) -> Result<()>

// Distribute SOL rewards
pub fn distribute_rewards(
    ctx: Context<DistributeRewards>,
) -> Result<()>
```

### 3. NFT Operations (anchor-spl usage)
```rust
// Mint winner badge NFT
pub fn mint_winner_badge(
    ctx: Context<MintWinnerBadge>,
    badge_type: String,
    metadata_uri: String,
) -> Result<()>

// Mint trophy NFT
pub fn mint_trophy_nft(
    ctx: Context<MintTrophyNft>,
    trophy_type: String,
    metadata_uri: String,
) -> Result<()>
```

## Dependencies (Cargo.toml)
```toml
[dependencies]
anchor-lang = "0.31.0"
anchor-spl = "0.31.0"    # ONLY for NFT minting
solana-program = "1.18.0"

[features]
idl-build = [
    "anchor-lang/idl-build",
    "anchor-spl/idl-build",  # Required for NFT operations
]
```

## Program Flow

### 1. Time Capsule Creation
1. User pays 0.00005 SOL creation fee
2. Program creates `Capsule` account
3. Program creates NFT `Mint` account (using anchor-spl)
4. Content stored on IPFS, hash stored in capsule
5. Optional: Initialize guessing game

### 2. Guessing Game Flow
1. Creator initializes game with SOL-based fees
2. Users submit guesses (free or paid in SOL)
3. Program verifies correct guesses
4. Rewards distributed in SOL (50% winner, 20% creator, 30% app)
5. Winner receives NFT badge (using anchor-spl)

### 3. Achievement System
1. User stats tracked in `LeaderboardEntry`
2. Achievements unlock trophy NFT eligibility
3. Trophies minted as NFTs (using anchor-spl)

## Security Features
- PDA-based account generation
- Time-based reveal validation
- Authorization checks for all operations
- Overflow protection for arithmetic
- Comprehensive error handling

## Integration Points
- **IPFS/Filecoin**: Content storage (off-chain)
- **X API**: Social sharing and hints (off-chain)
- **ElevenLabs**: AI audio generation (off-chain)
- **Solana Mobile SDK**: TEEPIN/SKR integration (mobile)
- **React Native**: Mobile app interface (client)

## Summary

Your CapsuleX project uses SPL tokens **exclusively for NFT functionality** (capsules, badges, trophies) through the `anchor-spl` crate. The core game economics run on SOL for all fees and rewards, making it simple and gas-efficient. This design perfectly balances functionality with simplicity - you get the benefits of NFT ownership without the complexity of custom token economics.

The program is now complete and ready for integration with your React Native mobile app and off-chain services (IPFS, X API, ElevenLabs, etc.).
